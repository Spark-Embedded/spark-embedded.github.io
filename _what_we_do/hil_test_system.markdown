description: "To bridge the gap from simulation to reality, we develop the software for Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test systems. Using LabVIEW, we architect test systems using the physics models developed during MBSD to run real-time simulations that test how your physical controller's production code performs under a wide range of operating and fault conditions."
