description: "To reduce bugs and accelerate your timeline, we employ Model-Based System Design (MBSD) using MATLAB and Simulink to create a 'digital twin' of your system for early virtual validation. This front-loaded approach allows us to refine your requirements early on and finds bugs before they become expensive problems, resulting in a more reliable, flexible system delivered faster."
